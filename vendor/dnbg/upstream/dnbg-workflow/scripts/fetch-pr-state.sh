# One call per question would cost this tick three or four requests on a curve
# whose floor is ten seconds, so the unit here is the tick rather than the
# question. Which fields a forge can answer together is a forge's own business:
# GitHub needs a second request for inline comments, GitLab's discussions arrive
# with the MR.
#
# `degraded=<source>` reports a source that failed while others answered — the
# object is emitted without it rather than the whole tick being lost. The caller
# grades a degraded source on its own counter, since one source failing forever
# while the rest answer is a blind watch wearing a healthy one's costume.

# split between `normalise` and the fetch exists so that change touches one
# function. Nothing above this line is GitHub-shaped — that is the contract.
