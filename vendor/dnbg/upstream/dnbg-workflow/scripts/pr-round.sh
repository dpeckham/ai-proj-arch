# One review round's context in a single call: the delta diff, new activity, the
# standing verdict, and every unresolved thread. Both sides of a review need all
# four every round, and they were four separate steps of prose each — which a
# script cannot be two-thirds of, the way a prose sequence can.
#
#   pr-round.sh <owner/repo> <pr> <since-sha> <since-iso> <slug>
#
# <since-sha> is the SHA you last handled, empty on a first look; <since-iso>
# marks "handled up to here"; <slug> is the login whose own activity to exclude —
# your own, in both spellings GitHub uses for a bot (`<slug>`, `<slug>[bot]`).
# The same four values re-arm watch-pr.sh, so a caller carries one state tuple.
#
# Prints three delimited sections, then one result line, then exits 0:
#   ── diff ──
#   <unified diff>
#   ── activity ──
#   {"kind":"review|comment|inline","author":…,"at":…,"body":…}
#   ── threads ──
#   {"id":"PRRT_…","path":…,"line":…,"author":…,"body":…}
#   result=OK head=<sha> verdict=<state> verdict_sha=<sha> at_head=0|1
#     reviewed_after_head=0|1|unknown
#     review_decision=<state> verdict_src=<s> diff=delta|full|none|fail
#     activity=<n> reviews_src=<s> inline_src=<s> threads=<n> threads_src=<s>
#
#   result=ERROR reason=bad-args   # nothing was queried
#
# Each `<s>` is `ok`, `fail` (the request did not come back) or `shape` (it came
# back and stopped parsing) — pr-sources.sh's vocabulary, meaning the same there.
#
# ⚠️ A FAILED SOURCE STILL PRINTS `result=OK`, NAMING THAT SOURCE. The other three
# parts are a real answer, so suppressing them would be worse — but an empty
# section means "nothing there" only where its `_src` reads `ok`. A caller that
# ignores those fields reports a blind fetch as a quiet round.
#
# `verdict=` is passed through from pr-verdict.sh rather than recomputed. What
# counts as a verdict is pinned across exactly two files by tests/coupling.bats,
# and the extra `gh pr view` that costs is cheaper than a third copy of the set.
#
# Threads are not narrowed to the bot's. A human reviewer's thread blocks the
# merge just as surely; each line carries `author` for a caller that wants only
# its own. `pr-threads.sh --mine` is the narrowed read, for the resolve loop.
#
# Inline comments are read newest-first, one page: the endpoint is oldest-first
# by default, so on a PR past 100 inline comments page one is pure history and
# nothing new ever appears. The bound traded for is 100 new inline comments in
# one round.
#
# Runs under your own gh auth, like every read here — `GH_TOKEN` is unset, and
# the children inherit that.
