# Reviewer: re-reviewing a moved HEAD

Part of the `reviewer` skill. Read this on a `COMMITS` return, or whenever the
author asks for another look; `references/watch.md` routes here and `SKILL.md`
carries the first pass.

When asked to re-review a PR your bot already reviewed — new commits were pushed,
or the author asks for another look — post a fresh review. The verdict is keyed
to the new HEAD.

**Take the round in one call** — the delta diff, whatever landed in
conversation, your standing verdict, and every unresolved thread. The watcher
prints this call as its `── next ──` line with the arguments filled in; run that
rather than composing it:

```bash
"<skill-dir>/../../scripts/pr-round.sh" <owner>/<repo> <n> <last-reviewed-sha> <since_iso> <slug>
```

Those are the values you already track for the watcher, so the input is on hand.
It prints `── diff ──`, `── activity ──` and `── threads ──` sections, then one
result line carrying `verdict`, `verdict_sha`, `at_head`, `reviewed_after_head`
and a `_src` status per source. Pass `""` for the SHA on a first review; that
asks for the full diff.

The diff is the **delta** wherever a prior SHA exists — exactly the changes your
last verdict didn't cover, rather than the whole PR again. `diff=none` means HEAD
hasn't moved since you handled it, which is the normal answer on an `ACTIVITY`
wake and costs no request at all.

An empty section means "nothing there" only where its `_src` reads `ok`; `fail`
or `shape` means that source went blind, which is not a quiet round.

- **Prior verdict `--approve`**: **re-post a verdict whenever HEAD has moved past
  the SHA your standing approval is attached to** — `--approve` if the new diff is
  still clean, `--request-changes` if it introduces issues. Even when your verdict
  is unchanged, and including no-op-substance pushes (whitespace, formatter,
  merge-from-base). **Name the SHA in the body** ("Re-approving at `1a2b3c4`").

  The trigger is the SHA mismatch, not whether the change was substantive.
  Judging substantive-ness is what fails here:
  the author cannot distinguish silence-because-trivial from
  silence-because-the-reviewer-is-gone, so both read as a reviewer who might still
  speak, and their watcher waits for a signal you decided not to send.

  It also moves the *record*, not just the conversation. A review carries a
  `commit_id`, and GitHub renders a stale approval in the merge box with no
  caveat — one green check over "read the new commits and is fine", "hasn't looked
  yet", and "no verdict is ever coming". A fresh verdict re-attaches `commit_id`
  to the current HEAD, so "is HEAD approved?" becomes answerable from the API by
  the author, a human merger, or a later session, without asking anyone.

  **Review the delta before re-approving.** This rule invites rubber-stamping,
  which is worse than the silence it replaces: silence is merely uninformative,
  while a verdict nobody stood behind is confidently wrong and gets merged on.

- Whether GitHub dismissed the approval on the push does not enter into it. Under
  the rule above you re-verdict either way, so the repo's *Dismiss stale pull
  request approvals* setting changes no behaviour of yours — don't read branch
  protection to decide this (it needs **admin** and answers 403/404 on write-only
  access, so the branch was unreliable as well as unnecessary). Where stale
  dismissal genuinely bites, GitHub already forces the re-approval and this rule
  is a no-op; it only fires in the ambiguous case.
- **Prior verdict `--request-changes`**: the PR stays blocked until a fresh
  review lands (a top-level comment doesn't dismiss it). `--approve` if the new
  diff fixes the findings; `--request-changes` again if not. If the new commits
  are no-op substance that didn't address the findings, leave it — the PR stays
  correctly blocked.

"Has HEAD moved past my verdict?" is answered by the packet's own `at_head` and
`reviewed_after_head`, which are `pr-verdict.sh`'s answer carried through — the same question the
author's side asks as "is HEAD approved?", which is the point of keeping the
record current. Outside a round, ask it directly:

```bash
"<skill-dir>/../../scripts/pr-verdict.sh" <owner>/<repo> <n>
```

Your verdict is current iff the result line reads `at_head=1 reviewed_after_head=1`.
The script takes the last **verdict**, not the last approval — an `APPROVED`
followed by a `CHANGES_REQUESTED` on the same SHA is not an approval, and
`COMMENTED` (what a thread reply posts) is not a verdict at all.
`reviewed_after_head` is the third condition because a force-push re-anchors an
existing review onto the rewritten commit, leaving `at_head=1` over a tree you
never saw — re-review it. That is invisible to a **resumed or fresh session**,
which has no `LAST_HEAD` baseline to catch the push with.
`tests/pr-verdict.bats` pins all three. `result=ERROR`, and `unknown` in that
field, both mean the check could not see — not that your verdict is stale.

Where approvals are **required**, `reviewDecision` answers "is HEAD approved?"
directly and is the primary source — it handles supersession and multiple
reviewers, which this comparison does not. This is the answer where no approval
is required, and it is the only one there: `reviewDecision` is `null`, and
neither the merge box nor `dismiss_stale_reviews` fills the gap.

Alongside the fresh review, **resolve any inline thread whose concern is now
answered** — `SKILL.md`'s "Resolving inline findings" carries the mechanics.
