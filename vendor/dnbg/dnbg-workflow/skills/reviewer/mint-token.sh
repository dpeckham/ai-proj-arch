#   license:  Apache-2.0 (see vendor/dnbg/LICENSE)
# Changes (search for "ai-proj-arch"):
#   - DNBG_REVIEWER_REPOSITORIES: optional comma-separated repo names. When
#     set, the token is scoped to just those repositories instead of the whole
#     installation. Unset keeps upstream behavior. Candidate to offer upstream.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Mint a short-lived GitHub App installation token for the local
# reviewer bot, and print it to stdout. Use it as `GH_TOKEN` for the `gh`
# commands that post the review, so the review posts under the bot identity
# rather than your own account.
#
#   GH_TOKEN="$(.../mint-token.sh <owner>)" gh pr review <n> --repo <owner>/<repo> ...
#
# The optional first argument is the target repo's owner (org or personal login;
# `owner/repo` is also accepted and trimmed). The bot may be installed on several
# accounts (an org and your personal account), so the token is scoped to the
# installation on that owner. With no argument it falls back to the first/only
# installation (fine for a single-account setup, e.g. the setup verify step).
#
# Credentials are written by the `reviewer-setup` skill into the config dir
# (default ~/.config/dnbg/reviewer): config.json + private-key.pem. The App
# private key never leaves this machine — this script signs a JWT locally and
# exchanges it with GitHub for an installation token.
#
# ## Where the key comes from
#
# Three sources, tried in this order. The first that yields a key wins:
#
#   1. DNBG_REVIEWER_PRIVATE_KEY          the PEM itself, in the environment
#   2. DNBG_REVIEWER_PRIVATE_KEY_COMMAND  a command whose stdout is the PEM
#      (or `private_key_command` in config.json)
#   3. $CONFIG_DIR/private-key.pem        the plaintext file bootstrap.py writes
#
# Two more variables stand in for config.json fields, so a headless run needs no
# config file at all. Both fall back to config.json when it exists:
#
#   DNBG_REVIEWER_APP_ID           required — without it there is no JWT to sign
#   DNBG_REVIEWER_INSTALLATION_ID  optional — skips the /app/installations
#                                  lookup; otherwise it is resolved from <owner>
#
# (2) is the single hook that reaches every secret manager without this project
# knowing any of them exist — `op read`, `pass show`, `security find-generic-
# password -w`, `secret-tool lookup`, `vault kv get`, `sops -d`. `git`'s
# `credential.helper` is the precedent.
#
# ⚠️ THE COMMAND IS READ ONLY FROM USER CONFIG OR THE ENVIRONMENT, NEVER FROM A
# REPOSITORY, and that is the property the whole feature's safety rests on. It is
# safe because someone who can write `~/.config/dnbg/reviewer` can already write
# `~/.zshrc` or swap the PEM outright — so the command grants no capability they
# lacked. That argument evaporates the instant a repo can supply the value, which
# is the class of bug `credential.helper` has been bitten by repeatedly. Nothing
# here reads a config file from the working directory, and a test asserts it.

# Refuse a credential anyone but the owner can rewrite, the way ssh refuses an
# over-permissive private key. A 0600 PEM in a 0777 directory is not protected:
# the file cannot be read, but it can be REPLACED, and this script would then
# sign a JWT with the attacker's key and hand back a real token for the bot.
#
# `find -perm` rather than `stat`: the format flags differ between BSD and GNU
# (`stat -f '%Lp'` vs `stat -c '%a'`), and this comparison does not need the
# number — only whether either write bit is set.
#
# `-L`, and it is load-bearing in both directions. Without it `find` stats the
# symlink rather than its target, and a symlink's own mode is `0777` on Linux
# unconditionally (`symlink()` ignores umask). So every config dir or PEM that a
# dotfile manager — stow, chezmoi, dotbot — has linked into `~/.config` would be
# refused however locked-down the real directory is, on all three routes, and the
# remedy this prints could not clear it: `chmod` follows the link, so `chmod go-w`
# would re-chmod the already-correct target and leave the link at `0777` forever.
# It is also the weaker check: without `-L`, a link pointing at a genuinely
# world-writable directory is let straight through. Both verified by hand.

# between `mktemp` and installing it, so "no key on disk" would hold only most of
# the time. Process substitution gives openssl `/dev/fd/N`, which is the pipe:
# nothing to strand, on any signal.
#
# This matters only for the env and command routes. Someone using `op read` has
# decided the key is not to sit at rest on this disk, and quietly writing it to
# TMPDIR on every mint would reverse that decision without telling them. The file
# route is exempt above — its key is already on disk, so it hands over the path.
#
# Verified signing from a pipe under OpenSSL 3.6.2 and LibreSSL 3.3.6; CI covers
# Linux. Deliberately NOT falling back to a temp file if this fails: openssl
# exits 1 both for "cannot open the key" and "the key is malformed", with
# different wording per implementation, so a fallback cannot tell those apart —
# it would fire on a bad key and write it to disk before failing anyway, dropping
