# List a PR's unresolved review threads, or resolve one. Both sides of a review
# need this: the author enumerates what is still outstanding before claiming a
# round is handled, and `reviewer` resolves its own threads once the finding is
# answered.

#   pr-threads.sh <owner/repo> <pr> --resolve <thread-id>
#
# Listing prints one compact JSON object per line — id, path, line, author, body
# — then a result line, then exits 0:
#   {"id":"PRRT_…","path":"api/server.go","line":42,"author":"…","body":"…"}
#   result=OK count=<n>
#
#   result=OK resolved=<thread-id>          # --resolve
#   result=ERROR reason=bad-args|no-slug|graphql|graphql-shape|resolve
#
# JSONL rather than one array so the common reads need no jq at all: an agent
# reads the objects directly, and a caller that only wants the count (the
# `BLOCKED`-cause diagnostic in `git-workflow`) reads `count=` off the result
# line instead of piping through `wc -l`. `jq -s .` reassembles an array if one
# is ever wanted.
#
# `--mine` filters to threads whose FIRST comment is authored by the configured
# reviewer bot — what `reviewer` needs to find its own outstanding findings, and
# what an author must NOT use, since a human reviewer's threads block the merge
# just as surely.
#
# Match the bot on the App `slug`, not `bot_login`. GraphQL reports a Bot
# author's `login` WITHOUT the `[bot]` suffix (e.g. `agent-reviewer-<you>`), so
# matching `…[bot]` never hits and `--mine` silently returns nothing — a filter
# that finds no outstanding findings looks exactly like having none. Both
# spellings are accepted here so the same flag works if GitHub ever reports the
# suffixed form through GraphQL too.
#
# ⚠️ AN EMPTY SLUG IS FATAL UNDER `--mine`, NOT A DEFAULT. An empty match string
# selects no thread at all, which reads as "nothing outstanding" — the same
# silent-blindness shape the watcher's slug guard exists to prevent. Bail instead.
#
# `--resolve` runs under whatever `GH_TOKEN` the caller exports, which for the
# reviewer is its own App token. That needs `contents: write`; without it
# `resolveReviewThread` answers `FORBIDDEN: Resource not accessible by
# integration`.
#
# Reads the first 100 threads. A PR past that is far outside anything this
# workflow produces, and the failure would be under-reporting rather than a wrong
# answer — but it is a cap, so it is stated rather than left to be discovered.
